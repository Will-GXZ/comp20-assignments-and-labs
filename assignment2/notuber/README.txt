Tufts Comp20 Assignment2 The Black Car Service 

Mar 25, 2017
________________________________________________________________________________

    This assignment is the front end part of the Black Car Service project. This 
web page uses a Google Maps API and JSON, HTML5 geolocation API to share locations 
of each user. The web page communicates with the server via XMLHttpRequest Object. 

    First, I will send my location and username to the server. If I were a driver 
and I want to find some passengers nearby, the server will get my POST request and 
send back a JSON file that contains information of passengers. The web page will 
display a map with markers at my location and passengers. We can check username 
and distance from me of a passenger by click the marker of that passenger. If I 
were a driver/vehicle, vice-versa.
